# Angular Workshop

## Initial MyTasks project

The current code in this project contain the MyTasks application that we did together in the presentation. 

We covered the following stuff:
- Create an Angular new project
- Add two components Tasks and Task
- Add a tasks service to handle a list of the tasks with the abilities to add and remove tasks
- Implement 'Add Task' and 'Remove' buttons
- Used Template-driven form to bind the tasks model to the task component inputs
- Add a pipe to filter the tasks by its status
- We used *ngFor directive
- We used @Input and @Output


## Exercises
